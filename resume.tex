% You can change the base color of this cv by altering the RGB values of \definecolor{maincolor}{RGB}{102, 204, 51} in class file:  cv-roald.cls. It will automatically define a darker and lighter shade of this color. The darker shade is used for the background of the header, the lighter for the contact details in the header and the maincolor is used for the titles.
